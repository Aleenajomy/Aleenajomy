Full-Stack Developer | React • Python • Django  
📍 Kerala, India

I am a Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience building responsive frontend interfaces and secure backend systems using **React, Python, and Django**. I enjoy working across the entire web stack — from crafting clean UI components to designing RESTful APIs with authentication and role-based access control.

I focus on writing readable, maintainable code and continuously improving my understanding of backend architecture and frontend performance.
